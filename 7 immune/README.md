## 1. Biological Inspiration: Clonal Selection Principle

* **Immune system basics**
  In vertebrate immune systems, B-cells carry receptors (“detectors”) that bind antigens (foreign molecules). When a B-cell receptor binds well to an antigen (high affinity), that B-cell proliferates (clones itself) and its clones undergo hypermutation—random tweaks to their receptors. The best‐matching clones are retained as “memory cells.”

* **Key ideas transplanted to machine learning**

  1. **Detection**: Data points (antigens) are “recognized” by a set of detectors (memory cells).
  2. **Clonal expansion**: High-affinity detectors are cloned.
  3. **Hypermutation**: Clones mutate randomly, exploring the feature space around good detectors.
  4. **Selection**: The mutated clones that bind even better replace their parents, refining the detector set.
  5. **Memory**: After several generations, the system retains detectors that best “cover” each class of antigen.

## 2. Overview of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**
   Randomly pick a small subset of the training data as initial “memory cells,” each tagged with its true class label.

2. **Iterative Clonal Selection** (for a fixed number of generations):
   For each training sample (antigen) in turn:
   a. **Find best matching unit (BMU)** among current memory cells by measuring affinity (how “close” the detector’s feature vector is to the antigen).
   b. **Clone the BMU** a fixed number of times.
   c. **Hypermutate each clone** by adding Gaussian noise to its feature vector.
   d. **Evaluate** all clones’ affinity to the same antigen and pick the best one.
   e. **Replace** the BMU in memory if its best clone is an improvement.

3. **Classification**
   To classify a new sample, compute affinities to all memory cells and assign the class label of the BMU.

## 3. Code Walkthrough

### 3.1. Initialization

```python
class ArtificialImmuneClassifier:
    def __init__(self,
                 n_detectors=20,
                 n_clones=5,
                 mutation_rate=0.05,
                 n_generations=10):
        self.n_detectors   = n_detectors   # Size of memory cell pool
        self.n_clones      = n_clones      # How many clones per selected detector
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate # Std. dev. of Gaussian noise
        self.n_generations = n_generations # Number of clonal selection rounds
        self.memory_cells  = []            # Will hold dicts {'vector':…, 'label':…}
```

* **n\_detectors**: how many detectors (memory cells) to maintain.
* **n\_clones**: clones per selection step.
* **mutation\_rate**: controls exploration—higher → more varied clones.
* **n\_generations**: how many full passes over the data to refine detectors.

---

### 3.2. Affinity Function

```python
def _affinity(self, v1, v2):
    # Negative Euclidean distance: closer vectors → higher affinity
    return -np.linalg.norm(v1 - v2)
```

* We want higher scores for more similar vectors; taking the negative L₂‐norm fulfills that.

---

### 3.3. Training (`fit`)

```python
def fit(self, X, y):
    # 1) Initialize: sample n_detectors from training set
    idxs = np.random.choice(len(X), self.n_detectors, replace=False)
    self.memory_cells = [{'vector': X[i], 'label': y[i]} for i in idxs]

    # 2) Iterative clonal selection
    for gen in range(self.n_generations):
        for antigen, label in zip(X, y):
            # a) Find best matching detector
            bmu = max(self.memory_cells,
                      key=lambda cell: self._affinity(cell['vector'], antigen))

            # b) Clone the BMU
            clones = [dict(bmu) for _ in range(self.n_clones)]

            # c) Hypermutate each clone
            for clone in clones:
                noise = np.random.normal(0, self.mutation_rate,
                                         size=antigen.shape)
                clone['vector'] = clone['vector'] + noise

            # d) Select the best clone
            best_clone = max(clones,
                             key=lambda cell: self._affinity(cell['vector'], antigen))

            # e) Replace BMU if clone is better
            if self._affinity(best_clone['vector'], antigen) > \
               self._affinity(bmu['vector'], antigen):
                # find BMU’s index and replace it
                idx = self.memory_cells.index(bmu)
                self.memory_cells[idx] = best_clone
```

* **Random initialization** ensures diversity of detectors from the start.
* **Cloning + mutation** explores the neighborhood around a good detector.
* **Replacement** gradually moves detectors closer to the manifold of each class.

### 3.4. Prediction

```python
def predict(self, X):
    y_pred = []
    for sample in X:
        # Find the memory cell with highest affinity to the sample
        bmu = max(self.memory_cells,
                  key=lambda cell: self._affinity(cell['vector'], sample))
        y_pred.append(bmu['label'])
    return np.array(y_pred)
```

* For each test point, simply assign it the label of its nearest detector.

## 4. End-to-End Pipeline in the Notebook

1. **Data Generation**

   ```python
   X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000,
                              n_features=10,
                              n_informative=6,
                              n_redundant=2,
                              n_classes=2,
                              random_state=42)
   ```

   Creates a two-class problem with 10 features (6 informative).

2. **Train/Test Split**

   ```python
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
       X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

3. **Training the Classifier**

   ```python
   model = ArtificialImmuneClassifier(
               n_detectors=20,
               n_clones=10,
               mutation_rate=0.05,
               n_generations=10)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

4. **Prediction & Evaluation**

   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   acc   = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
   cm    = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

   print(f"Test Accuracy: {acc*100:.2f} %")
   print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)
   ```

5. **Visualization**
   A seaborn heatmap of the confusion matrix highlights true vs. predicted class counts.

## 5. Key Hyperparameters & Trade-offs

* **Number of Detectors (`n_detectors`)**
  More detectors can cover the input space more finely but increase computational cost.

* **Number of Clones (`n_clones`)**
  More clones give a better chance of finding improved detectors in each iteration.

* **Mutation Rate**
  Low rate → fine local search; high rate → broader exploration but risk “overshooting.”

* **Generations (`n_generations`)**
  More rounds refine detectors further but cost more time.

Tuning these lets you balance accuracy vs. runtime and avoidance of local optima vs. over‐mutation.

### In a Nutshell

This implementation brings the **clonal selection** mechanism of the immune system into classification. Detectors evolve by cloning and hypermutation, gradually honing in on representative prototypes for each class. At prediction time, the nearest (highest‐affinity) detector decides the label.
