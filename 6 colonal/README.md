## 1. Algorithm Overview

The Clonal Selection Algorithm is an **artificial immune system** meta-heuristic inspired by how our biological immune system responds to pathogens:

1. **Initialization**
   Generate a diverse “population” of candidate solutions (antibodies).

2. **Affinity Evaluation**
   Measure how well each antibody “matches” the problem (the higher the match, the higher the affinity).

3. **Selection & Cloning**
   Probabilistically select high-affinity antibodies and make multiple copies of them.

4. **Hypermutation**
   Mutate these clones, with a mutation rate that may depend on affinity (higher-affinity clones mutate less, preserving good solutions).

5. **Re-selection (Replacement)**
   Combine the mutated clones with the original population and keep the best individuals.

6. **Termination**
   Repeat steps 2–5 for a fixed number of iterations (or until convergence), then return the best found solution.

## 2. High-Level Pseudocode

```
Initialize population P of size N
for t = 1 to T:
    Compute affinity f(x) for each x ∈ P
    Select S ⊆ P (with replacement) proportionally to f(x)
    Clone each member of S to form C
    Mutate members of C with some mutation rate μ
    Combine P and C → P′
    Select top-N from P′ by affinity to form the next P
return best member of P
```

## 3. Code Walkthrough

Below is how each function in your script maps to the CSA steps:

### 3.1 `initialize_population(population_size, solution_size)`

```python
def initialize_population(population_size, solution_size):
    population = []
    for _ in range(population_size):
        antibody = np.random.uniform(low=-10, high=10, size=solution_size)
        population.append(antibody)
    return population
```

* **What it does:**
  Creates `population_size` vectors of length `solution_size`, each initialized uniformly at random in \[–10, 10].
* **Role in CSA:** Step 1: generate the initial antibody repertoire.

---

### 3.2 `calculate_affinity(population)`

```python
def calculate_affinity(population):
    affinities = []
    for antibody in population:
        fitness  = np.sum(antibody ** 2)      # we’re minimizing ∑ xᵢ²
        affinity = 1 / (1 + fitness)          # higher fitness ⇒ higher affinity
        affinities.append(affinity)
    return affinities
```

* **What it does:**
  Computes a fitness (here, the sum of squares → lower is better) and converts it into an affinity score via

  $$
    \text{affinity}(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \text{fitness}(x)}.
  $$
* **Role in CSA:** Step 2: evaluate how “good” each solution is.

---

### 3.3 `select_antibodies_for_cloning(population, affinities)`

```python
def select_antibodies_for_cloning(population, affinities):
    total_affinity = sum(affinities)
    probabilities  = [aff / total_affinity for aff in affinities]

    # Sample integer indices 0…N−1 according to these probabilities
    idxs = np.random.choice(
        a=len(population),
        size=len(population),
        p=probabilities,
        replace=True
    )
    # Return the sampled antibodies
    return [population[i] for i in idxs]
```

* **What it does:**
  Normalizes affinities into a probability distribution, then samples **indices** (with replacement) so higher-affinity antibodies are more likely to be chosen.
* **Role in CSA:** Step 3: select and clone promising antibodies.

---

### 3.4 `clone_antibodies(selected_antibodies)`

```python
def clone_antibodies(selected_antibodies):
    return selected_antibodies.copy()
```

* **What it does:**
  Creates a shallow copy of the selected list. (If you wanted **multiple** clones per antibody based on its affinity, you could repeat each antibody a number of times proportional to its affinity.)
* **Role in CSA:** Still part of Step 3: form the clone pool.

---

### 3.5 `mutate_antibodies(cloned_antibodies, mutation_rate)`

```python
def mutate_antibodies(cloned_antibodies, mutation_rate):
    mutated_antibodies = []
    for antibody in cloned_antibodies:
        if random.random() < mutation_rate:
            mutation = np.random.uniform(low=-1, high=1, size=antibody.shape)
            antibody = antibody + mutation
        mutated_antibodies.append(antibody)
    return mutated_antibodies
```

* **What it does:**
  For each clone, with probability `mutation_rate`, adds a small random vector in \[–1, 1]^d.
* **Role in CSA:** Step 4: introduce diversity around high-affinity solutions.

---

### 3.6 `select_next_generation(population, mutated_antibodies, affinities)`

```python
def select_next_generation(population, mutated_antibodies, affinities):
    combined_population = population + mutated_antibodies
    combined_affinities = calculate_affinity(combined_population)

    # Keep the top N individuals by affinity
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(combined_affinities)[::-1]
    next_generation = [combined_population[i] for i in sorted_indices[:len(population)]]
    return next_generation
```

* **What it does:**
  Merges the original and mutated pools, then picks the best `population_size` members by affinity.
* **Role in CSA:** Step 5: selection for the next generation.

---

### 3.7 `best_antibody(population, affinities)`

```python
def best_antibody(population, affinities):
    best_index = np.argmax(affinities)
    return population[best_index]
```

* **What it does:**
  Finds the highest-affinity antibody in the current population.
* **Role in CSA:** Utility for extracting the final solution.

### 3.8 `clonal_selection_algorithm(...)`

```python
def clonal_selection_algorithm(population_size, solution_size, mutation_rate, num_iterations):
    antibodies = initialize_population(population_size, solution_size)

    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        affinities             = calculate_affinity(antibodies)
        selected_antibodies    = select_antibodies_for_cloning(antibodies, affinities)
        cloned_antibodies      = clone_antibodies(selected_antibodies)
        mutated_antibodies     = mutate_antibodies(cloned_antibodies, mutation_rate)
        antibodies             = select_next_generation(antibodies, mutated_antibodies, affinities)

    # After T iterations, return the best found
    final_affinities = calculate_affinity(antibodies)
    return best_antibody(antibodies, final_affinities)
```

* **Flow:**

  1. **Init** → 2. **Evaluate** → 3. **Select & Clone** → 4. **Mutate** → 5. **Re‐select** → repeat.
  2. **Return** the top solution.

---

## 4. Tuning & Extensions

* **Mutation rate** (`mutation_rate`)
  Controls exploration vs. exploitation. Lower rates preserve good solutions; higher rates explore more.

* **Affinity-based cloning**
  You could clone each antibody a number of times ∝ its affinity (rather than a flat copy) to intensify search around the very best.

* **Adaptive mutation**
  Make `mutation_rate` a function of affinity (e.g. higher‐affinity clones mutate less).

* **Elitism**
  Always carry over the best one or two antibodies unchanged.

---

### Final Thoughts

The CSA strikes a balance between:

* **Exploitation** (cloning high-affinity solutions)
* **Exploration** (mutating them to discover new candidates)

Mapping each biological metaphor—antibody, affinity, cloning, mutation—onto standard evolutionary operators makes the CSA a flexible optimization framework.
