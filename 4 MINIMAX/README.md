# Fuzzy Set Theory ‚Äì Detailed Explanation of Python Implementation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the fuzzy set operations and fuzzy relation functions as implemented in the given Python code.

## üìå Introduction to Fuzzy Sets

Fuzzy set theory generalizes classical set theory by allowing elements to have degrees of membership in the interval $[0, 1]$. Instead of simply belonging or not belonging to a set, an element can belong *partially*. This is particularly useful in modeling uncertainty and vagueness.

In this context, fuzzy sets `A` and `B` are represented as dictionaries in Python, where keys are elements and values are their membership degrees.

## üßÆ Fuzzy Set Operations

### 1. Fuzzy Union

```python
def fuzzy_union(A, B):
    return {x: max(A.get(x, 0), B.get(x, 0)) for x in set(A) | set(B)}
```

**Theory:**
The membership function of the union of two fuzzy sets $A \cup B$ is defined as:

$$
\mu_{A \cup B}(x) = \max(\mu_A(x), \mu_B(x))
$$

In the code, the union is computed by taking the maximum membership value for each element that appears in either `A` or `B`.

### 2. Fuzzy Intersection

```python
def fuzzy_intersection(A, B):
    return {x: min(A.get(x, 0), B.get(x, 0)) for x in set(A) & set(B)}
```

**Theory:**
The intersection $A \cap B$ of two fuzzy sets is given by:

$$
\mu_{A \cap B}(x) = \min(\mu_A(x), \mu_B(x))
$$

The code uses the minimum membership value for elements common to both `A` and `B`.

### 3. Fuzzy Complement

```python
def fuzzy_complement(A):
    return {x: 1 - A[x] for x in A}
```

**Theory:**
The complement $\overline{A}$ of a fuzzy set is defined as:

$$
\mu_{\overline{A}}(x) = 1 - \mu_A(x)
$$

This reflects the degree to which an element does **not** belong to the set.

### 4. Fuzzy Difference

```python
def fuzzy_difference(A, B):
    return {x: min(A.get(x, 0), 1 - B.get(x, 0)) for x in set(A)}
```

**Theory:**
The difference $A - B$ in fuzzy logic is not symmetric and is defined as:

$$
\mu_{A - B}(x) = \min(\mu_A(x), 1 - \mu_B(x))
$$

This captures how much an element belongs to `A` but *not* to `B`.

## üîÅ Fuzzy Relations

### 5. Cartesian Product

```python
def cartesian_product(A, B):
    return {(x, y): min(A[x], B[y]) for x in A for y in B}
```

**Theory:**
The Cartesian product $A \times B$ of fuzzy sets is a fuzzy relation $R$ where:

$$
\mu_R(x, y) = \min(\mu_A(x), \mu_B(y))
$$

This creates a fuzzy relation between every pair of elements from `A` and `B`.

---

### 6. Max-Min Composition

```python
def max_min_composition(R, S):
    T = {}
    for (x, y1) in R:
        for (y2, z) in S:
            if y1 == y2:
                T[(x, z)] = max(T.get((x, z), 0), min(R[(x, y1)], S[(y2, z)]))
    return T
```

**Theory:**
The max-min composition of two fuzzy relations $R$ and $S$ is defined as:

$$
\mu_T(x, z) = \max_{y} \min(\mu_R(x, y), \mu_S(y, z))
$$

This function finds the composition of two fuzzy relations by comparing all intermediate elements $y$ and combining their respective values using the min-max principle.

## üß™ Example Input and Output

### Input Fuzzy Sets:

```python
A = {'a': 0.5, 'b': 0.7, 'c': 0.2}
B = {'b': 0.6, 'c': 0.8, 'd': 0.4}
```

### Output:

```
Union: {'a': 0.5, 'b': 0.7, 'c': 0.8, 'd': 0.4}
Intersection: {'b': 0.6, 'c': 0.2}
Complement of A: {'a': 0.5, 'b': 0.30000000000000004, 'c': 0.8}
Difference (A - B): {'a': 0.5, 'b': 0.4, 'c': 0.19999999999999996}
Cartesian Product R: {('a', 'b'): 0.5, ('a', 'c'): 0.5, ...}
Max-Min Composition: {('a', 'a'): 0.5, ('a', 'b'): 0.5, ...}
```
